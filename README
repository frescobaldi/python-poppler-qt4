python-poppler-qt4
==================

A Python binding for libpoppler-qt4 that aims for completeness and for being
actively maintained.

Created and currently maintained by Wilbert Berendsen <wbsoft@xs4all.nl>.


Usage:
======

import popplerqt4

d = popplerqt4.Poppler.Document.load('file.pdf')


Documentation:
==============

The Python API closely follows the Poppler Qt4 C++ interface library API,
documented at http://people.freedesktop.org/~aacid/docs/qt4/ .

Whereever the C++ API requires QList, QSet or QLinkedList, any Python sequence
can be used.  API calls that return QList, QSet or QLinkedList all return Python
lists.

There are a few differences:

Poppler::Document::getPdfVersion(int *major, int *minor) can simply be called as
d.getPdfVersion() [where d is a Poppler::Document instance]; it will return
a tuple of two integers (major, minor).

Poppler::FontIterator (returned by Poppler::Document::newFontIterator) is also
a Python iterable (e.g. has __iter__() and __next__() methods). So although you
can use:

    it = document.newFontIterator()
    while it.hasNext():
        fonts = it.next()  # list of FontInfo objects
        ...

you can also use the more Pythonic:

    for fonts in document.newFontIterator():
        ...
